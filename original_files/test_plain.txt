Congratulations!  You get to see how I am testing grammar... new lines... and
all those cr@zy character$ that mäkēs the english language so unique.

I think that I will need more lines... so, here are some of my favorite bands:
- MeTaLlIcA
- Rise Against
- Pink Floyd
- Trampled By Turtles
- Led Zeppelin

Rock on you guys... shine on you crazy diamonds.
